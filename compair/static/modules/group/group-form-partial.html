<h1>Add Group</h1>
<p class="intro-text">Add a group and then add any users from your course to it. Groups can be used to <strong>give group-based assignments</strong> (where students submit one answer per group but complete comparisons and self-evaluations individually) and <strong>filter completed student answers and comparisons into smaller subsets</strong> to help with grading.</p>

        <div class="instructional-text">
            <p>Note that group names will be visible to students after comparing completes, so it is best to <strong>keep these names anonymous</strong> (i.e., do not include any identifying information like names or student numbers).</p>
